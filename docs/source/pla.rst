Commodore 64 PLA
================

This design is a replica of the PLA chip used in the Commodore 64 home computer, but implemented through discrete logic rather than an actual PLA. Implementing this circuit in a way that does not cause timing problems with other chips inside the Commodore 64 requires specific input-to-output propagation delays to be met. As this delay was difficult to estimate for this multi-project die, several different delay lengths are selectable through the ``CASDEL[1:0]`` and ``DEL`` inputs. The former selects a delay specifically for the ``CASRAMn`` output, while the latter selects the delay for all other outputs. All of these inputs have built-in pull-ups, meaning any delay can be selected by hardwiring or bonding specific inputs to ground.

When ``DEL`` is high, it selects additional delay. Otherwise, no additional delay is added.

``CASDEL[1:0]`` features four possible delay settings:

PLA Pin descriptions taken from `the C64 wiki <https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/PLA_(C64_chip)>`__.

All unused pads should be hardwired or bonded to ground, if possible.
